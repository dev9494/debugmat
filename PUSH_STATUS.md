# 🚀 Pushing to GitHub...

## Status: In Progress ⏳

Your code is being pushed to GitHub right now!

**Repository**: https://github.com/dev9494/debugmate

---

## What's Happening:

Git is uploading all your files to GitHub. This might take a minute because:
- You have many files (source code, node_modules excluded, documentation, etc.)
- First push uploads everything
- GitHub needs to process all the files

---

## ⏱️ Expected Time:

- **Small projects**: 10-30 seconds
- **Medium projects**: 30-60 seconds  
- **Your project**: ~1-2 minutes (you have lots of files!)

---

## ✅ What Happens Next:

Once the push completes:

1. ✅ Your code will be on GitHub
2. ✅ You can view it at: https://github.com/dev9494/debugmate
3. ✅ We'll deploy to Vercel
