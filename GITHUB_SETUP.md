# 🚀 GitHub Setup - Almost Done!

## ✅ What I've Done So Far:

2. ✅ Configured Git with your name
3. ✅ Created .gitignore file
4. ✅ Added all files to Git
5. ✅ Created initial commit
6. ✅ Renamed branch to 'main'

## 📋 What You Need to Do Next:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open: https://github.com/new
   - Or click: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Repository name**: `debugmate` (or any name you like)
   - **Description**: `AI-powered debugging assistant with unique features`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one!)
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore (you already have one!)
   - **DO NOT** choose a license yet

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands.

**Look for the URL that looks like:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/debugmate.git
```

**Copy this URL!** You'll need it for the next step.

### Step 3: Tell Me the URL

Once you have the URL, paste it here and I'll push your code to GitHub!

**Example:**
```
https://github.com/matan123/debugmate.git
```
