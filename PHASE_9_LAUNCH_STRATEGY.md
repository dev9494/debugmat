### Product Hunt First Comment
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built DebugMate to solve a problem every developer faces: debugging is time-consuming and frustrating.

**The Problem:**
Developers spend 30-50% of their time debugging. Error messages are cryptic, solutions are scattered across Stack Overflow, and fixing bugs feels like detective work.

**The Solution:**
DebugMate uses AI to:
✅ Analyze any error in seconds
✅ Generate working solutions
✅ Explain root causes clearly
✅ Prevent similar bugs

**How it works:**
1. Paste your error message
2. Get AI-powered analysis
3. Apply the fix
4. Ship faster

**Free tier:** 5 analyses/month
**Pro tier:** $19/month for unlimited

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

### Twitter Launch Thread
```
🚀 Launching DebugMate on @ProductHunt today!

An AI-powered debugging assistant that turns hours of debugging into seconds.

Here's what makes it special 🧵

1/12

---

The average developer spends 30-50% of their time debugging.

That's 2-4 hours EVERY DAY staring at error messages, searching Stack Overflow, and trying random fixes.

There had to be a better way.

2/12

---

So I built DebugMate - an AI assistant that:

✅ Analyzes any error instantly
✅ Explains what went wrong
✅ Generates working solutions
✅ Prevents similar bugs

All in seconds, not hours.

3/12

Hey r/SideProject! 👋

I just launched DebugMate on Product Hunt, and I'd love your feedback.

**What it does:**
Paste any error message → Get AI-powered solution in seconds

I was tired of spending hours debugging simple errors. Error messages are cryptic, Stack Overflow is hit-or-miss, and debugging felt like guesswork.

**Tech stack:**
- React + TypeScript
- Google Gemini AI
- Firebase
- Vercel

**Features:**
- Instant error analysis
- Solution generation
- Root cause explanation
- Error history tracking
- Free tier (5/month) + Pro ($19/month)

**What I learned:**
